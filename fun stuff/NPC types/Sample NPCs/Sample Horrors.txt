+npc/set app=They look just like you. /Just/ like you, only ever so subtly flipped on the long axis. If you're left-handed, they're right handed. That mole on your right cheek is on their left. If you cut them open, you'll find that they suffer from situs inversus totalis: mirrored internal organs. But then, so do about one in ten thousand people born right here on earth, so you have to look for more than that to tell them for what they are. Like when their smiles warp into funhouse horror masks, limbs stretching like images in rippled glass, reaching out to seize and drag and stuff you back through grandma's old gilt-framed Victorian. Because just one of them escaping is never enough. They want to bring all their brothers and sisters through with them.
+npc/set note/stats=Mirror People have the same Attributes, Skills, and Merits as the person they mimic. If their victim's Strength is lower than 4, the Mirror Person has a Strength of 4.
